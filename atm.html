            <p>ATM stands for Applied Technology Magnet. This overall was a great opportunity for me since Bancroft is the only middle school that actually has this program, so Iâ€™m pretty lucky. I was also able to learn about many programs to have fun with or if I want to do it as an actual job. This class also gave me a better understanding of how everything on the internet works. Without this class I wouldn't have been able to really do anything on the computer much less make this website.</p>
