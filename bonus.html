            <p>The main reason for why I want to fight against poverty is because my family in <a class="liner" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela">Venezuela</a> are living in extreme poverty right now. Even though we send them money, there is nothing to really buy. There are no more medicines, hardly any food, and hardly anything else. They even start having blackouts more often. Many people in the world, in other countries, don't have much money. In fact almost half of Earth's population live on about $2.50 each day. 22 million kids die every day because of poverty. Millions of people in the world don't have any food to eat. The number one cause of death is hunger. Many people actually die because they don't have any hygiene materials like clean water or soap. So when you don't want to eat the food on your plate and you just want to throw it away, think of the millions of people around the world who would fight for just the scraps of your food. So please, do not waste any food or water because that is a blessing.</p>
